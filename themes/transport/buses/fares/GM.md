REQUEST FOR INFORMATION UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT 
2000 
 
Please find below TfGM’s response to your Freedom of Information request 
which was received at this office on 29/02/2019. 
 
Information requested as set out below: 
“Please can you make provide bus fare data in 'csv format' that you hold for all 
local bus services operating in GM 
 
This follows the precedent set by your organisation in releasing the bus fare 
tables for all of GM in 2010. Your view was that the information was already in 
the public domain therefore there was no reason for it not to be released.” 
 
Please find below link to the information you have requested.

review. If you would like an internal review you should contact me in the first
